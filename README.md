# HOW TO SUBMIT NEW ACCOUNTS
To submit a new account you'd like to see on the list either:
1. List is an issue on this page
2. Message "mymycanzoo" on X/Twitter, requesting the account you would like listed.
I will vet the account, to see that they are legitimately deserving to be listed before adding them.

# Panoptes
A chromium extension made to highlight accounts that indulge in the "BNWO" fetish

# INSTALLATION
Click the Code button (green) and select Download ZIP.
Save the Panoptes-master.zip file to your computer (e.g., Downloads folder) and extract it (right-click > Extract All on Windows, or double-click and drag on macOS).

# Load the Extension in Brave:
Loading your Panoptes extension on any Chromium-based browser (e.g., Brave, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera) is a straightforward process since they all support the same extension framework. Below are the step-by-step instructions to load it as an unpacked extension, which works for development or personal use.

Open the Browser:
Launch the Chromium-based browser you want to use (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera).
Access the Extensions Page:
Type the following in the address bar and press Enter:

Chrome: chrome://extensions/

Brave: brave://extensions/

Edge: edge://extensions/

Opera: opera://extensions/

The exact URL varies slightly, but all use a ://extensions/ format.
Enable Developer Mode:
In the top-right corner of the extensions page, toggle the Developer mode switch to On. This enables loading unpacked extensions.
Load the Unpacked Extension:
Click the Load unpacked button (appears after enabling Developer mode).
In the file explorer dialog, navigate to C:\downloads\panoptes-master.
Select the folder and click Select Folder (Windows) or Open (macOS/Linux).
Confirm Loading:
The extension should appear in the list with its name, version, and description.


# INSTALLATION (FIREFOX)
For Firefox Users (Temporary Installation)
Open Firefox browser.
Type about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox in the address bar and press Enter.
Click the Load Temporary Add-on button.
Navigate to the extracted folder (e.g., downloads\panoptes-master) and select any file (e.g., manifest.json).
The extension should appear under "Temporary Extensions."
Test the Extension:
Visit x.com and check if listed users (e.g., @GodKneels6Trump) are highlighted in their assigned colors with category tooltips.
Note: This is a temporary installation and will be removed when Firefox restarts unless reloaded.
Notes
Editing Accounts: Modify accounts.js to add or remove usernames under each category.
Permanent Installation: For a permanent version, this extension will be available on the Firefox Add-ons site after review. Check back for updates!
