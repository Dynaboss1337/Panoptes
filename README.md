# HOW TO SUBMIT NEW ACCOUNTS
To submit a new account you'd like to see on the list either:
1. List is an issue on this page
2. Message "mymycanzoo" on X/Twitter, requesting the account you would like listed.
I will vet the account, to see that they are legitimately deserving to be listed before adding them.
